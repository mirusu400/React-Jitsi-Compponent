## About the project

A react component for accessing the low level api of the open source conference software Jitsi. This allows you a complete customization of the video conference within react. This is a translation of the vanilla JS example file from [lib-jitsi-meet](https://github.com/jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet). This is only for testing purpose, right now it uses the public Jitis Meet Server for connection, if you work on, please use your own Jitsi instance.
